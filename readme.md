## My degree final project

Nowadays a lot of smart cities are offering to their citizens a group of applications that uses open data, a type of data that contains information about tourism, events, transport or whatever related to these cities. The main goal of these applications is giving facilities and improving the life quality of the citizens. The problem appears when these citizens are moving to other cities and the applications that they were using usually in their city are not useful anymore, and consequently they have to download new applications that do the same function that the ones they used to utilize. 

The purpose of this project has been to look for a solution for this conflict, developing an application that gives information about events and expositions of any smart city which offers open data related to events. One application for all the
cities in the world, trying to solve the Open Data integration problem.
